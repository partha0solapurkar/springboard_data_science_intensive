# Springboard's Data Science Intensive Workshop

This repository contains all of my projects from Springboard's Data Science Intensive Workshop. 

- The capstone_project directory contains the main project, based on Airbnb's new users activity data. I analyze the data and build models to identify eager users and hesitant users in order to make recommendations about targeted marketing. 

- The other directories contain various mini-projects on data wrangling, statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques.
