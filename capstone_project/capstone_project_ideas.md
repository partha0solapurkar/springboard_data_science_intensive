# Three ideas for the Capstone Project

## Airbnb New User Bookings data
The dataset is about user details and their web session records. The goal is to predict whether a user will make a booking and if yes, where their first booking will be.

## Expedia Hotel Recommendations data
The dataset is about logs of customer behavior. These include what customers searched for, how they interacted with search results (click/book), whether or not the search result was a travel package. The goal is to predict the booking outcome for a user event, based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event.

## Bosch Production Line Performance data
