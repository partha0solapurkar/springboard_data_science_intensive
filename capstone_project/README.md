# The Capstone Project

I explore Airbnb user data to glean insights and to create two models:

- model_hesitant_users.ipynb contains a model that identifies users who are NOT likely to make a booking, with high recall. These users may be targeted with special promotions in order to increase the conversion rate. 

- model_eager_users.ipynb contains a model that identifies users who are likely to make a booking, with high precision. These users are likely to make a booking anyway, so no special promotions necessary for these users. 

The dataset it too large and is not included in this repository. It may be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data 

This project is being completed under the guidance of Ankit Jain. I would like to thank Ankit for all his help and suggestions.
