# Capstone Project Proposal

### Introduction 
Not all of the users who create an account on a website make a purchase. I plan to analyze user activity data in order to help develop strategies to improve the conversion rate of new users by working with the marketing team. 

### Dataset 

The dataset is the Airbnb new user bookings dataset available from https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data. Roughly 60 percent of the users do not make a booking. The goal is to develop strategies to lower this number. 

### How to target hesitant users 

I plan to develop a model that predicts the users who are not likely to make a booking. This model aims to identify such users with high recall. These users may then be targeted with more aggressive marketing and special promotions. 

### How to target eager users 

I plan to develop a model that predicts the users who are very likely to make a booking. This model aims to identify such users with high precision. The revenue may be increased by offering less discounts and promotions to these users, since they're likely to make a booking anyway. 

### Other analysis 

I plan to analyze the dataset and glean actinable insights such as seasonal patters in user bookings. For example, if people are likely to make a booking in the summertime anyway, there is no need of offering promotions in the summer. On the other hand, if people are less likely to make a booking in the wintertime, it would be a good idea offer special promotions in the winter.

### Deliverables 
The deliverables will be a technical notebook with code, a report, a slide deck and the two models mentioned above.
